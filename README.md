- If you don't know what SA-MP is, a good place to start would be to read [Why A Million People Still Play Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Every Month](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/15/why-a-million-people-still-play-multiplayer-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-every-month/ "Article"), an article by Richard Moss from Rock Paper Shogun.

- However if you do know what SA-MP is, then you know that it has one of the largest Russian speaking communities in gaming. Despite its huge size, the Russian community and the English speaking community rarely interact with each other because of the language barriers.

- SA-MP Translate's purpose is to break the language barrier in SA-MP by providing world class translations in real time.
- With the SA-MP Translate API, server owners can instantly translate their servers from Russian to English (and vice versa).
- We believe that by breaking the language barrier in SA-MP we can create a better experience for all the players.
